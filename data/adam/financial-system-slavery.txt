The modern financial system is a structure built on systemic dependency. Most people must trade their time, labour, and attention for money in order to secure their basic needs — not out of genuine freedom, but because the system locks survival behind a paywall.

This creates a hierarchy: institutions, owners, and banks control the supply and creation of money, while individuals must comply with the logic of the system to survive. This is not slavery in the historical sense, but it is a form of economic coercion that limits human freedom.

Calling it “slavery” is not exaggeration — it is an accurate description of a system where survival is conditional on labour in a structure designed by those who benefit most from it.
